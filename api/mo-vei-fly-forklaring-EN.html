      <h2 id="prinsipper">Key Principles</h2>

      <p>
        To understand how presentation and routing work, it is
        important to understand how the solution handles the entire process of goods
        arriving at the customs area.
      </p>
      <p>
        For arrival, presentation, routing, and entry, the solution
        is based on some key principles:
      </p>

      <div class="boxed">
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Norwegian Customs automatically
              detects the arrival of the means of transport.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Norwegian Customs automatically
              carries out the presentation of consignments based on the reported expected
              load in the means of transport.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Norwegian Customs automatically
              provides routing signals for the transport and consignments.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Norwegian Customs automatically
              registers allowed entry to the customs area and initiate the transition to
              the chosen customs procedure.</strong></li>
        </ul>
      </div>


      <p>
        In addition to these key principles, the solution must be
        able to support exceptions. There are several exceptions that lead to deviations from
        the basic concept in various scenarios:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>Automatic detection of arrival and provision of routing not possible.</li>
       <li>Businesses have received permission, upon
           application, to present goods at a location other than the border crossing
           point.</li>
       <li>In exceptional cases, Norwegian Customs may
           grant conditional entry pending the completion of document control. The
           relevant goods should remain untouched and stored at an agreed location.</li>
       <li>Norwegian Customs decides to physically
           inspect a consignment at the unloading location or the location of
           presentation instead of the border crossing point.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2 id="gjennomgang">Review of a &quot;standard&quot; process based on the key principles</h2>

      <p>
        For the modes of transportation covered by the Digitoll
        solution, namely road, train, and air transportation, the same main process
        will apply:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Businesses submit a complete set of
          messages covering transport, master consignment(s), and house
          consignment(s) for a transport that is set to arrive at the customs area.
          The messages must be submitted in advance, and no later than upon arrival.
        </li>
        <li>
          When the means of transportation arrives
          at the customs area, the Norwegian Customs will attempt to automatically
          detect it.
          <ul>
            <li>
              For <em>road</em> transport, this is
              done through ANPR (automatic number plate recognition) at Ørje and
              Svinesund, camera 1, or other border crossing solutions (currently under
              development/testing).
            </li>
            <li>
              For <em>air</em> transport, this is
              achieved by using services from Avinor, or manually by customs officers
              at airports not operated by Avinor.
            </li>
            <li>
              For <em>train</em> transport, the
              solution is not yet fully defined, but a similar approach as for air
              transport is assumed.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Once Norwegian Customs has registered the
          arrival of the means of transportation, on behalf of the sender (in
          practice, those who have submitted transport, master consignment, and
          house consignment messages), the goods will be digitally presented.
          <ul>
            <li>
              This means that in &quot;normal cases&quot;, businesses will not need to perform their own digital
            presentation.
            </li>
            <li>
              Other variations will be described
              separately (see <em><a href="#hvorfor_eget">Why
              a separate interface (API) for presentation?</a></em>).
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Norwegian Customs will then provide routing
          for the consignments, allowing businesses to access this information.
          <ul>
            <li>
              The routing interface is a
              &quot;pull&quot; interface, where the business identifies itself and
              receives all routing information for the consignments relevant to the
              business.
            </li>
            <li>
              The business that submitted a house
              consignment message, or is mentioned in the message as the customs
              representative can retrieve routing for the house
              consignment(s).
            </li>
            <li>
              The business that submitted a master
              consignment message or is mentioned in the message as the customs
              representative can retrieve routing for all house consignments associated
              with the master consignment.
            </li>
            <li>
              The business that submitted a transport
              message or is mentioned in the message as the customs representative can
              retrieve routing for all consignments associated with all master
              consignments connected to the transport.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Norwegian Customs will then, at a time depending on the mode of
          transportation, allow entry to the customs area and transition
          to the chosen customs procedure for all consignment listed in
          the transport.
          <ul>
            <li>For air and train transports, this
              occurs immediately after routing is made available.</li>
            <li>For road transportation, this happens
              when the transport leaves the customs area (camera 2).</li>
          </ul>

      </ol>

      <h2 id="fremlegging">Presentation in Digitoll</h2>

      <p>
        As mentioned above, the key principle of presentation is
        that all goods arriving at the customs area are automatically presented
        digitally by Norwegian Customs on behalf of the means of transportation's
        operator. The operator is typically not the one submitting information. In
        practice, this means that presentation will be carried out, and the results of
        the presentation will be made available to the operator (where practical) and
        to those representing the operator. For road transport operators, this means
        that routing will be made available in the form of a light signal. The details
        of routing are explained in the following section.
      </p>

      <h3 id="hvorfor_eget">Why is there a separate interface (API) for presentation?</h3>

      <p>
        This interface allows a business to voluntarily make
        digital presentations of consignments. Presentation can be performed by
        businesses that have not been pre-registered in the messages for transport,
        master consignments, or house consignments. By presenting consignments
        digitally, this business can then access routing for the presented
        consignments.
      </p>

      <p>
        The idea is to accommodate businesses like &quot;ground
        handlers&quot; responsible for handling goods arriving by air, where the
        airline has submitted the Notification and Disclosure of Information data, and
        the airline itself acts as the customs representative. In such cases, there may
        be a need for the ground handler to &quot;sign up&quot; for the transport in
        order to receive information to handle consignments upon arrival.
      </p>

      <p>
        The general rule is that use of the presentation interface
        is not required. This is an interface that can be used when needed, without
        causing issues.
      </p>

      <p>Submitted <strong>questions</strong>:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <em>At what point should presentation be
            used? Is it based on polling, or is there a specific time when the data
            becomes available? Who should use it, and are there criteria for when it
            should be used or not used?&nbsp; Similarly, for routing, is it the case
            that any party (e.g., the sender of house consignment number 15 on a truck
            with 100 consignments) should use it and be responsible for the entire
            transports actions based on the routing information?
          </em>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Answer</strong>:<br/>
              As mentioned earlier, it is not necessary for businesses to submit
              presentation. The exception is in very specific cases where the business
              needs to obtain routing without having been involved in the submission of
              messages beforehand. <br/>
              Regarding routing, it will be necessary for businesses receiving house
              consignments/master consignments upon arrival to retrieve routing
              information. This may occur at an airport (typically by a ground handler)
              or when the business has permission to transport consignments from the
              arrival point to their sorting facility (e.g., postal services, express
              companies). Other businesses may wish to retrieve routing information to
              use it in their logistics flow.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>


      <h2 id="dirigering">Routing in Digitoll</h2>

      <p>
        As mentioned earlier, routing will be made available based
        on automatic arrival and digital presentation. Routing will not be available
        until the transportation has been registered as arrived. The routing interface
        is a &quot;pull&quot; interface, where the business identifies itself and
        receives all routing instructions for consignments that are relevant to the
        business. In practice, this means that the interface has only one parameter, a
        label, so that the business can retrieve all new routing instructions since the
        last routing was fetched. Consignments are retrieved based on who identifies
        themselves in Maskinporten (organization number) and the label for the last
        fetched routing.
      </p>

      <h3 id="hvemhva">Who can retrieve what?</h3>

      <p>
        In principle, it is the sender of the message and the
        customs representatives mentioned in the message (if it is a different party)
        who can retrieve routing for consignments. Additionally, businesses that need
        to present consignments and thus access routing signals for these can do so.
      </p>

      <ol>
       <li>The business that submitted a house
           consignment message or is mentioned in the message as the customs
           representative can retrieve routing for that house consignment.</li>
       <li>The business that submitted a master
           consignment message or is mentioned in the message as the customs
           representative can retrieve routing for all house consignments associated
           with the master consignment.</li>
       <li>The business that submitted a transport
           message or is mentioned in the message as the customs representative can
           retrieve routing for all house consignments associated with all master
           consignments linked to the transport.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        For each consignment, routing will contain a reference to
        the consignment and a routing signal.
      </p>

      <h2 id="eksempler">Examples</h2>

      <h3 id="Eksempel1">Example 1</h3>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Norsk Transport AS has a truck on the way (transport) with
          4 master consignments and four house consignments. Well before crossing the
          border, Norsk Transport AS has submitted the master consignment, and the
          freight forwarder Speditør 1 AS has submitted master consignment A and B, while
          Speditør 2 AS has submitted master consignment C and D. Norsk Transport AS has
          ensured that references to all four master consignments are included in the
          transport message.
        </p>
        <p>What do the different parties do next to use these two APIs?</p>
      </blockquote>


      <p>
        In general, none of these parties should need to submit a
        presentation message. In principle no parties will be required to retrieve
        routing, as this is road transport.
      </p>

      <ol>
       <li>In a normal case, the driver will receive
           a green light at the customs office, and all consignments will be
           transitioned to the selected customs procedure (the one submitted in the
           consignment message). </li>
       <li>If one or more consignments or the entire
           transport have been selected for a physical inspection, the driver will
           receive a red light and must go to the customs checkpoint. Normally the
           inspection will be carried out at the customs site. Alternatively, the
           driver may be instructed to go to another customs site for the inspection.
           </li>
       <li>If one or more consignments or the entire
           transport have deficiencies in the submission of information, the driver
           will receive a red light and must go to the customs office. Typically,
           this will need to be resolved before the transport can proceed. In exceptional
           cases, Norwegian Customs may decide that the transport can proceed to a
           customs warehouse for submission there.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        The relevant parties can, if they wish, request routing
        through the interface. They will then receive information about any deviations
        and the status of those transitioned to the desired customs procedure, such as
        immediate release or warehouse release.
      </p>


      <p>In this example:</p>
      <ul>
       <li>&quot;Norsk Transport AS&quot; can
           request routing for all consignments that are indicated to arrive on the
           transport.</li>
       <li>&quot;Speditør 1 AS&quot; can request
           routing for all consignments that are indicated to arrive on the transport
           and are linked to master consignments A and B.</li>
       <li>&quot;Speditør 2 AS&quot; can request
           routing for all consignments that are indicated to arrive on the transport
           and are linked to master consignments C and D.</li>
      </ul>

          -Transport is granted entry permission and a green light.<br/>

          not released.<br/>

          - Consignments for physical inspection must be delivered to Norwegian Customs.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Norwegian Customs has received and processed information about
        transport, master consignments, and house consignments, including information
        about the transition to the next customs procedure for 1533 house consignments.
        Based on the received data, one house consignment is selected for physical
        inspection, and one house consignment is selected for document inspection
        (based on missing customs procedure).
      </p>
      <p>
        At 06:25, Norwegian Customs retrieves arrival information from
        Avinor and discovers that flight EX0836, with a scheduled time of 06:00, has
        arrived. Norwegian Customs has received a message about this transport and carries
        out a digital presentation on behalf of the operator (in practice, on behalf of
        Express AS). Routing is immediately made available for 1534 consignments. 1532
        consignments are transitioned to the selected customs procedure, in this case,
        immediate release. One house consignment is directed to physical inspection,
        and one to document inspection (see <a href="#merknadA">note /A/ below</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        Express AS uses the routing interface and retrieves
        routing, thus receiving routing for 1534 house consignments. Express AS's
        customs department becomes aware that one house consignment lacks submitted
        information. The routing information is entered into Express AS's sorting
        facility.
      </p>
      <p>
        Express AS picks up the consignments at Gardermoen and
        transports them to their sorting facility at Helsfyr. In the meantime, the
        customs department at Express AS finds the missing information for the house
        consignment selected for document inspection and submits the correct customs
        information. Norwegian Customs receives and processes this information and
        provides routing for the consignment. Everything is in order, and the
        consignment is granted entry and transitions to immediate release. Express AS
        retrieves routing information and now receives the updated information for the
        release of the consignments that were supposed to undergo document inspection
        (see <a href="#merknadA">note /A/ below</a>). The updated
        information is loaded into the sorting facility.
      </p>
      <p>
        The consignments are loaded onto the sorting facility as
        the transport from OSL arrives at Helsfyr 35 minutes later. 1533 house
        consignments are sorted for further distribution to Express AS's customers
        since they have been processed for immediate release. One consignment is sorted
        for physical inspection, and Express AS transports it to Norwegian Customs for
        inspection.
