      <p>
        This guide provides advice on how businesses can navigate the question
        of 'who does what' in fulfilling the digital notification and disclosure
        of information obligation.
     </p>

      <h2 id="aktorer">Stakeholders</h2>

      <p>
        For goods arriving by air, we are aware that there can be multiple
        stakeholders with various roles involved. We have identified some of
        those roles, which may be relevant in the process of digitally fulfilling
        the notification and disclosure of information obligation. Here, we will
        list some of them and describe their involvement.

                The customs representative acts on behalf of the represented party and

                It is possible to have a customs representative digitally fulfill the obligation
                for a house consignment, a master consignment, or a transport, or any combination
                of these.

                A freight forwarder is an individual or a company that organizes the consignment

                Typically, the freight forwarder will digitally fulfill the information part of the
                obligation by submitting details about consignments and master consignments.<br/>
                Additionally, a freight forwarder can also ensure compliance with the declaration
                obligation on behalf of the cargo owner.

        Responsibility for fulfilling the notification and disclosure of

      </h2>

      <p>
        In accordance with the law and regulations, it is the operator, typically represented
        by the <strong>carrier</strong> (airline), who is responsible for fulfilling the notification
        and disclosure of information obligation.<br/>
        This means that in most cases, it will be the<strong>carrier</strong> (airline) or
        their customs representative who should take responsibility for submitting the transport
        notification and ensure that the notification of master consignment and house consignment
        is submitted.
      </p>

      <h2 id="tidsplan">Timeline</h2>

      <p>
        Digital notification and disclosure of information becomes
        mandatory from February 1, 2026, at that point the existing
        courier manifest solution will also be discontinued.
        The direct transport scheme will be discontinued on September 1,
        2026.<br/>
        System support for submitting information
        to fulfill the notification and disclosure of information obligation
        digitally is already in place in Digitoll.
      </p>

      <p>
        There is a significant gain for businesses in starting early with adaption for digital
        fulfillment of obligations to Norwegian Customs. Business stakeholders should plan
        and implement measures for digital collaboration so that these obligations can be
        fulfilled in a correct and efficient manner.
      </p>

      <h3 id="overgangsperioden">Transition period</h3>

      <p>
        In the period between when Digitoll is made available from Norwegian Customs,
        until all stakeholders have fully adopted it, there will be a need to manage
        the processes around notification and disclosure of information obligations
        with temporary arrangements for digital collaboration. This may involve one
        stakeholder performing actions that would normally be done by others, or the
        exchange of information occurring through manual or semi-automated channels,
        such as email. The Digitoll program is happy to assist the stakeholders
        in arriving at such solutions.
      </p>

      <p>
        The examples below are based on the assumption that all participating stakeholders
        have fully implemented solutions to fulfill notification and disclosure of
        information obligations and have digital collaboration solutions among themselves.
        Scenarios where consignments have a pre-notification obligation (ICS2) are excluded.
      </p>

      <h2> Scenarios for task distribution among the stakeholders</h2>
      <p>(when Digitoll is fully implemented by the stakeholders)</p>

      <h3 id="scenario1">Scenario 1</h3>

      <p>
        <em>Express company with a fully integrated solution:</em><br/>
        Typically, such a company will act as a customs representative for the
        operator and handle all aspects of the digital fulfillment of the
        notification and disclosure of information obligation.
      </p>

        <figcaption>Click for larger picture</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h3 id="scenario2">Scenario 2</h3>

      <p>
        <em>A <strong>ground handler</strong> is the customs representative and handles
        transportation on behalf of the carrier(airline)<br/>
        A <strong>freight forwarder</strong> handles the master consignment,
        house consignment, and the next customs procedure (declaration).</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        Here, the <strong>ground handler</strong> will report the transport to Digitoll
        on behalf of the <strong>transporter</strong> (airline). The notification of
        transport should include a list of keys to all master consignments.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <strong>ground handler</strong> must then make sure to obtain key information
        about all master consignments (typically MAWB) to be included on the transport
        from the <strong>freight forwarder</strong>, so that links can be established.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <strong>freight forwarder</strong> submits a declaration in Tvinn for
        immediate release import (or other relevant customs procedure).<br/>
        The <strong>freight forwarder</strong> submits notifications of house
        consignments, including a link to the declaration in Tvinn,
        and notifications of master consignments to Digitoll.
      </p>

      <p>
       The <strong>ground handler</strong> will need to retrieve routing signals for
       consignments from Digitoll so that they can release master consignments and
       house consignments to the <strong>freight forwarder</strong>, then there
       is no need to place the goods in a customs warehouse.
       Keep in mind that placing goods in a customs warehouse will require a
       declaration (from September 1, 2026).
      </p>

      <h4>Digital collaboration</h4>
      <p>
        To complete the submission of information and fulfill the notification and
        disclosure of information obligation in this scenario, the <strong>ground handler</strong>
        and <strong>freight forwarder</strong> must exchange data.
        The <strong>ground handler</strong> needs to obtain the keys to all master
        consignments (MAWB) that will arrive with the aircraft from the
        <strong>freight forwarder</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        We recommend that the <strong>ground handler</strong> makes digital services
        available so that the <strong>freight forwarder</strong> can provide this
        information in a secure and efficient manner.
        The <strong>ground handler</strong> can then submit the notification of
        transport with the list of master consignments (MAWB numbers).
      </p>

      <h4>Arrival, presentation, and routing </h4>

      <p>
        Digitoll will automatically present consignments digitally to the stakeholders
        who have submitted information about transport, master consignments, and
        house consignments. This means that routing for consignments will be available
        in a hierarchy, where the stakeholder that submitted the notification of
        transport has access to all consignments reported on that transport, the one
        that submitted information about the master consignment has access to all
        house consignments under that master consignment. A stakeholder who has only
        submitted information about house consignment(s) only has access to the routing
        for those consignments.
      </p>

      <p>
        When retrieving routing information, the <strong>ground handler</strong> will
        receive information indicating whether consignments on the transport have been
        selected for inspection at the airport (border crossing point). Typically,
        consignments will not undergo inspection at the border crossing point, and
        the <strong>ground handler</strong> will then know that the consignments have
        been released to the <strong>freight forwarder</strong>. This avoids placing
        goods in the <strong>ground handlers</strong> customs warehouse, and the
        <strong>freight forwarder</strong> can retrieve the consignments without
        further processing.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <strong>freight forwarder</strong> will retrieve routing information
        from Digitoll for the consignments that the <strong>freight forwarder</strong>
        has reported. The <strong>freight forwarder</strong> can then pick up
        the consignments from the <strong>ground handler</strong>. If there are
        consignments that the <strong>freight forwarder</strong> has been informed
        will undergo inspection, the <strong>freight forwarder</strong> is responsible
        for delivering them to the agreed customs location as soon as possible.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the consignment has been released for the next customs procedure, such as
        immediate release import, the <strong>freight forwarder</strong> can proceed
        to the next step in their logistics process.
      </p>

      <h3 id="scenario3">Scenario 3</h3>

      <p>
        <em>
          The <strong>carrier</strong> (airline) submits the notification of transport.<br/>
          The <strong>freight forwarder</strong> handles master consignments and house consignments.<br/>
          The <strong>ground handler</strong> receives goods at the airport.
        </em>
      </p>

      <p>
        In this case the <strong>carrier</strong> (airline) will report the transport
        to Digitoll. The notification of transport should include a list of keys to
        all master consignments.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <strong>carrier</strong> (airline) must ensure they obtain key information
        about all master consignments (typically MAWB) that will be on board the
        aircraft from the <strong>freight forwarder(s)</strong>, so that links can be
        established. <br/> The <strong>freight forwarder(s)</strong> will submit
        notifications of house consignments and master consignments to Digitoll.<br/>
        The <strong>ground handler</strong> will need to retrieve routing signals for
        consignments from Digitoll so that they can release master consignments and
        house consignments to the <strong>freight forwarder</strong>, then there
        is no need to place the goods in a customs warehouse. Keep in mind that
        placing goods in a customs warehouse will require a declaration
        (from September 1, 2026).

      <h4>Digital collaboration</h4>

      <p>
        To complete the submission of information and fulfill the notification and
        disclosure of information obligation in this scenario, the
        <strong>carrier</strong> (airline) and <strong>freight forwarder</strong>
        must exchange data. The <strong>carrier</strong> (airline) must obtain
        the keys to all master consignments (MAWB) that will arrive with the aircraft
        from the <strong>freight forwarder(s)</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        We recommend that the <strong>carrier</strong> (airline) makes digital services
        available so that the <strong>freight forwarder</strong> can provide this
        information in a secure and efficient manner. The <strong>carrier</strong>
        (airline) can then submit the notification of transport with the list of master
        consignments (MAWB numbers).
      </p>

      <p>
        In this case there are several information elements the
        <strong>ground handler</strong> need in order to release consignments to the
        <strong>freight forwarder(s)</strong>. From the <strong>carrier</strong>
        (airline), they need the MRN for the notification of transport. Additionally,
        they need all MAWB numbers for the cargo that is expected to be on the aircraft.
        They can obtain this information from the <strong>carrier</strong> (airline),
        which submitted the notification of transport, or they can get the information
        from the <strong>freight forwarder(s)</strong>. Once they have this information
        (MRN for the notification of transport + MAWB), they can digitally present it
        in Digitoll. The fact that they have presented it digitally allows them to retrieve
        routing for the consignments when the aircraft arrives.
      </p>

      <h4>Arrival, presentation, and routing</h4>

      <p>
        Digitoll will automatically present consignments digitally to the stakeholders
        who have submitted information about transport, master consignments, and house
        consignments. This means that routing for consignments will be available in a
        hierarchy, where the stakeholder that submitted the notification of transport
        has access to all consignments reported on that transport, the one that submitted
        information about the master consignment has access to all house consignments
        under that master consignment. A stakeholder who has only submitted information
        about consignment(s) has access only to the routing of the consignment(s).
      </p>

      <p>
        When retrieving routing information, the <strong>ground handler</strong> will
        receive information indicating whether consignments on the transport have been
        selected for inspection at the airport (border crossing point). Typically,
        consignments will not undergo inspection at the border crossing point, and the
        <strong>ground handler</strong> will then know that the consignments have been
        released to the <strong>freight forwarder</strong>. This avoids placing goods in
        the <strong>ground handlers</strong> customs warehouse, and the
        <strong>freight forwarder</strong> can retrieve the consignments without further
        processing.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <strong>freight forwarder</strong> will retrieve routing information from
        Digitoll for the consignments that the <strong>freight forwarder</strong> has
        reported. The <strong>freight forwarder</strong> can then pick up the consignments
        from the <strong>ground handler</strong>. If there are consignments that the
        <strong>freight forwarder</strong> has been informed will undergo inspection, the
        <strong>freight forwarder</strong> is responsible for delivering them to the agreed
        customs location as soon as possible.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the consignment has been released for the next customs procedure, such as immediate
        release import, the <strong>freight forwarder</strong> can proceed to the next
        step in their logistics process.
      </p>

      <h3 id="scenario4">Scenario 4</h3>

        <strong>ground handler</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        In this case, there will be a need for digital collaboration between the
        <strong>freight forwarder</strong> and the road transporter, so that the road
        transporter can efficiently obtain the list of MAWBs to be picked up from the
        <strong>ground handler</strong>.<br/>

        The notification of transport should include a list of keys to all master
        consignments. The <strong>carrier</strong> (airline) submits notification
        of master consignment(s) and links them to the transport in the notification
        of transport.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is based on the hypothesis that the <strong>carrier</strong> (airline)
        issues the MAWB (master consignment) and provides the key for the MAWB number
        to the <strong>freight forwarder</strong>.
        The <strong>freight forwarder(s)</strong> submits notification of house
        consignments and master consignments to Digitoll.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <strong>ground handler</strong> will need to retrieve routing signals
        for consignments from Digitoll so that they can release master consignments
        and house consignments to the <strong>freight forwarder</strong>, then
        there is no need to place the goods in a customs warehouse. Keep in mind
        that placing goods in a customs warehouse will require a declaration
        (from  September 1, 2026).

      <h4>Digital collaboration</h4>

      <p>
        To complete the submission of information and fulfill the notification and
        disclosure of information obligation in this scenario, the
        <strong>carrier</strong> (airline) and <strong>freight forwarder</strong>
        must exchange data. The <strong>carrier</strong> (airline)must provide the keys
        to all master consignments (MAWB) that will arrive with the aircraft to
        the freight forwarder(s).<br/>
        For digital collaboration, the <strong>carrier</strong> (airline) must
        make the MAWBs available to the freight forwarder, for example, through
        a digital service. The <strong>freight forwarder</strong> must receive the
        correct keys (MAWB numbers) for the master consignments they are referring
        to in their house consignments when submitting them to Digitoll.
      </p>

      <p>
        For the ground handler to release consignments to the freight forwarders in
        this case, there are several information elements they depend on having
        available. From the <strong>carrier</strong> (airline), they need, at a minimum,
        the MRN for the notification of transport. Additionally, the ground handler
        needs all MAWB numbers that are reported to be in the expected load on the
        aircraft. They can obtain this information from the carrier. Once they have
        this information (MRN for the notification of transport + MAWB), they can
        digitally present it to Digitoll. The fact that they have presented it
        digitally allows them to retrieve routing for the consignments when the
        aircraft arrives.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>
          Ground handler is a customs representative and handles transportation on behalf of the carrier.<br/>
          Freight forwarder handles the master consignment and house consignment.<br/>
          Cargo owner handles the next customs procedure (declaration).
        </em>
      </p>

      <p>
        Here, the <strong>ground handler</strong> will report the transport to
        Digitoll on behalf of the <strong>carrier</strong> (airline). The notification of
        transport should include a list of keys to all master consignments. If the
        aircraft in question comes from a country outside the EU security zone, a
        pre-notification must be sent through ICS2. The <strong>ground handler</strong>
        must then ensure to obtain key information about all master consignments
        (typically MAWB) that will be on board the aircraft from the
        <strong>freight forwarder</strong>, so that linkage can be established.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <strong>cargo owner</strong> submits a declaration in TVINN for immdiate release
        import (or other relevant customs procedure).
      </p>

      <p>
        The <strong>freight forwarder</strong> sends messages about house consignments,
        including a link to the declaration in TVINN, and master consignments to Digitoll.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <strong>ground handler</strong> will need to retrieve routing signals
        for consignments from Digitoll so that they can release master consignments
        and house consignments to the <strong>freight forwarder</strong>, then there
        is no need to place the goods in a customs warehouse. Keep in mind that placing
        goods in a customs warehouse will require a declaration (from September 1, 2026).

      <h4>Digital collaboration</h4>

      <p>
        For the <strong>freight forwarder</strong> to be able to submit a
        complete notification of consignments, the <strong>cargo owner</strong> must
        convey the key to the declaration to the <strong>freight forwarder</strong>.
        To complete the submission of information and fulfill the notification and
        disclosure of information obligation in this scenario, the <strong>ground
        handler</strong> and <strong>freight forwarder</strong> must exchange data.
        The <strong>ground handler</strong> must acquire the keys to all master
        consignments (MAWB) that will arrive with the aircraft from the
        <strong>freight forwarder</strong>.<br/>
        We recommend that the <strong>ground handler</strong> makes digital services
        available so that the <strong>freight forwarder</strong> can provide this
        information in a secure and efficient manner. The <strong>ground
        handler</strong> can then submit a notification of transport with the list
        of master consignments (MAWB numbers).
      </p>

      <h4>Arrival, presentation, and routing </h4>

      <p>
        Digitoll will automatically present consignments digitally to the stakeholders
        who have submitted information about transport, master consignments, and house
        consignments. This means that routing for consignments will be available in a
        hierarchy, where the stakeholder that submitted the notification of transport
        has access to all consignments reported on that transport, the one that
        submitted information about the master consignment has access to all house
        consignments under that master consignment. A stakeholder which has only
        submitted information about house consignment(s) has access only to the routing
        of the house consignment(s).
      </p>

      <p>
        When retrieving routing information, the <strong>ground handler</strong>
        will receive information indicating whether consignments on the transport
        have been selected for inspection at the airport (border crossing point).
        Typically, consignments will not undergo inspection at the border crossing
        point, and the <strong>ground handler</strong> will then know that the
        consignments have been released to the freight forwarder. This avoids
        placing goods in the <strong>ground handlers</strong> customs warehouse,
        and the <strong>freight forwarder</strong> can retrieve the consignments
        without further processing.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <strong>freight forwarder</strong> will retrieve routing information from
        Digitoll for the consignments that the <strong>freight forwarder</strong> has
        reported. The <strong>freight forwarder</strong> can then pick up the consignments
        from the <strong>ground handler</strong>. If there are consignments that the
        <strong>freight forwarder</strong> has been informed will undergo inspection,
        the <strong>freight forwarder</strong> is responsible for delivering them to
        the agreed customs location as soon as possible.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the consignment has been released for the next customs procedure,
        such as immediate release import, the <strong>freight forwarder</strong>
        can proceed to the next step in their logistics process.
